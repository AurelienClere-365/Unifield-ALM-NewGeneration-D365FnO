# Unifield-ALM-NewGeneration-D365FnO

A collection of Azure DevOps pipeline templates for implementing Application Lifecycle Management (ALM) in Dynamics 365 Finance & Operations (D365FnO) using the Unified Developer Experience and Power Platform integration.

## 🚀 Overview

This project provides ready-to-use YAML pipelines to automate CI/CD workflows for D365FnO and Power Platform solutions. It supports unified package generation, build validation, environment management, and deployment to both LCS and Power Platform Admin Center (PPAC) environments.

## ✨ Features

- Unified package generation for D365FnO and Power Platform
- CI/CD automation with Azure DevOps
- Build validation for X++ code
- Environment provisioning and management
- Dataverse and BPA integration

## 🛠️ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Azure DevOps organization with required permissions
- Installed extensions:
  - [Dynamics 365 Finance and Operations Tools](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Dyn365FinOps.dynamics365-finops-tools)
  - [Power Platform Build Tools](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-platform/alm/devops-build-tools)
- X++ NuGet packages for your D365FnO version
- Service principal for Power Platform authentication

### Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AurelienClere-365/Unifield-ALM-NewGeneration-D365FnO.git


## 🤝 Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Feel free to:

- Open issues for bugs or feature requests
- Submit pull requests with improvements
- Share feedback on pipeline configurations

## ⚠️ Notes

- Ensure all pipeline tasks (e.g., Create Deployable Package, Add Licenses) use version 1 to support unified package generation.
- If your models require licenses, include them in the `__License` folder or configure the licensing task accordingly.
- Power Platform deployments require a service principal with appropriate permissions (e.g., System Administrator role in the target environment).
